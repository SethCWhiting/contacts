# Contacts

This is a basic CRUD application that I put together for Renescrow. I made the application to showcase my proficiency with Angular. I focused specifically on Angular's dynamic forms, as it seemed like a good fit to fulfill the needs of Renescrow's desired applications. On the backend, I used Google's Firebase service, and I built out the UI using Bootstrap 4.
